		<div class="heading">Movement and Defense Across the Animal Kingdom<div style="font-size:20px;"><br>By Julia Guo, Eton Victor, Brian Giordano, Daniel Santoro<br>Resch A4</div></div>
		<div class="box">Divergent and convergent evolution has allowed different animals to move around and defend themselves in many ways. Let's take a look.<br><div style="margin-top:10px;width:100%;height:100px;background-image:url(paws.png);background-size:contain;box-sizing: border-box;overflow:hidden;opacity:0.6;"></div></div>

		<div id="mollusca"><b>Squid / Phylum Mollusca</b><div style="font-size:16px;"><b>Movement</b><br>The squid mainly uses its siphon, tentacles, and head fins to move. Its siphon propels the squid through the water by pressing water from the pallial cavity through the siphon nozzle. Many other ocean mollusks, such as the octopus, move similarly; land mollusks such as snails, drag themselves around slowly using a foot. Other mollusks are sedentary.<br><b>Defense</b><br>The squid's main defense is to jet our a cloud of ink to confuse predators and easily escape. They also often wrap their arms around predators in an effort to prevent themselves from getting eaten. Physiology-wise, they have a robust beak made out of chitin for defense, bilateral symmetry for faster movement and easier escaping, and chromatophores in their skin for camoflauge (only some squids have this). Interestingly, squids have muscles in their mantle and tentacles (muscular hydrostat) similar to human tongue.</div>
		</div>

		<div class="pig"><b>Pig / Phylum Chordata, Class Mammalia</b><div style="font-size:16px;"><b>Movement</b><br>- Muscular system similar to most other mammals<br>- Striated skeletal muscles attach to an underlying skeleton and provide a framework for movement<br>- Smooth involuntary muscles control digestion and other internal processes<br>- Cardiac involuntary muscle, which is only found in the heart and controls heartbeat and function<br>- Bilateral symmetry<br><b>Defense</b><br>- Male pigs grow tusks used for offense<br>- Don't have particularly good eyesight, so they use their sense of smell and hearing to detect possible threats.<br>- Uses subcutaneous fat for energy and insulation</div></div>

		<div class="next1"><a href="#frog">V</a></div>

		<div id="frog"><b>Frog / Phylum Chordata, Class Amphibia</b><div style="font-size:16px;"><b>Movement</b><br>Bilateral symmetry<br>- Similar to pigs, frogs have a skeleton used as an underlying framework for striated muscles.<br>- Unlike the pig, which uses lungs controlled by a diaphragm, frogs use a method of breathing known as buccal pumping (breathing through the cheeks).<br>- The flow of oxygen is very important for frogs and pigs because they have muscles that require fresh oxygen for hemoglobin and myoglobin<br>- Frogs have very developed hind legs used for jumping, catching prey, and escaping predators. When compared to the pig, the greater amount of muscular development in the frog is quite startling<br>- Can walk, run, swim, dig, jump; not all frogs can do all of these motions, however.<br><b>Defense</b><br>- Has fat bodies in the abdomen that store energy<br>- Uses camouflage<br>- Runs/leaps away easily<br>- Produces toxins from glands in its skin<br>- Plays dead<br>- Swells up to give the appearance of additional mass<br>- Bright colors to indicate danger to predators</div></div>

		<div class="next2"><a href="#crayfish">V</a></div>

		<div id="crayfish"><b>Crayfish / Phylum Arthropoda</b><div style="font-size:16px;"><b>Movement</b><br>Crayfish and other arthropods use their muscles for extension and flexion, similar to chordates. They can walk on land or on seafloors using legs. Crayfish have small appendages known as swimmerets on the tail region for swimming.<br><b>Defense</b><br>Many arthropods have spikes protruding from the forelimbs as a form of physical defense. The crayfish can also use its tail as a rudder to propel itself backwards in the event of a predator approaching. Its forelimbs end in claws that can be used for hunting and defense; this is a trait that is shared with other arthropods such as crabs, and is analogous to the claws of some predatory chordates such as bears. Upon being threatened, the crayfish raises its claws in the air and engages in a self defense stance, in which it menacingly flashes its claws. As a general defense mechanism, arthropods have hard exoskeletons made of chitin, a structural polysaccharide.</div></div>
		
		<div class="grasshopper"><b>Grasshopper / Phylum Arthropoda (cont.)</b><div style="font-size:16px;"><b>Movement</b><br>Unlike ocean-based arthropods such as the crayfish, land-based arthropods like the grasshopper often have wings capable of flight. The grasshopper's primary method of locomotion is jumping using powerful hind legs. This jumping has a variety of functions, such as allowing them to escape from predators, propel themselves in the air in preparation for flight, or simply serve for general locomotion. The hind legs of the grasshopper are highly specialized and comparable to the frog's in the sense that they are highly enlarged for the particular purpose of jumping. These legs are powered by a series of developed muscles.<br><b>Defense</b><br>The coloring of grasshoppers and other insects allow them to camouflage with grassy environments. Their hard exoskeletons serve as protection from minor dangers. Typically grasshoppers and other insects do not confront enemies, and simply escape when faced with peril. Grasshoppers in particular have small chitin spikes on their rear legs to make them more difficult to eat</div></div>

		<div id="earthworm"><div style="margin-right:210px;"><b>Earthworm / Phylum Annelida</b><div class="earthwormimgs"><img src="earthworm.png" width=200px><br><br><img src="earthworm cross section.png" width=200px></div><div style="font-size:16px;"><b>Movement</b><br>Earthworms move using their flexible, segmented body, which is propelled by a series of muscles (known as the hydrostatic skeleton). They have two layers of muscles, circular and longitudinal, which run around their circumference and contract alternatively to move. Their skin has small bristles (setae), which help it grip to the soil and move more easily. These adaptations are true for most other annelids. Additionally, some annelids have appendages that resemble legs or tentacles, and others are able to use their powerful muscles to swim through water.<br><b>Defense</b><br>Firstly, earthworms' skin or ectoderm serves as a protective barrier from their surroundings. They also use receptor cells to detect possible danger; some other annelids use their eyes if they are well-developed enough. Annelids can release odor upon capture to seem less appealing to predators. They can also regenerate upon being cut into two; this is their main survival strategy since the chemicals they release may be ineffective. To avoid predators in the first place, they can burrow deep into the soil.</div></div></div>

		<div class="roundworm"><div style="margin-right:250px;"><b>Roundworm / Phylum Nematoda</b><div class="roundwormimgs"><img src="roundworm.png" width=200px></div><div style="font-size:16px;"><b>Movement</b><br>Nematodes move using a combination of longitudinal muscles and internal pressure. Since they have muscles that move in only one direction, they cannot crawl, only thrash.<br><b>Defense</b><br>Because they are mostly parasitic, nematodes do not necessarily need physical defenses from other animals. Instead, they have a variety of chemical defenses that prevent the host's immune system from killing them. They also have chemical defenses for non immune based microbial attacks.</div></div></div>

		<div class="next4"><a href="#sponge">V</a></div>

		<div id="sponge"><b>Sponges / Phylum Porifera</b><div style="font-size:16px;">Sponges are some of the simplest animals in existence. It is believed that they were actually one of the first animals on earth, and were formed when cells clumped together and created a language to communicate with each other. They were also one of the first sexual reproductive animals, made possible by choanocytes, or special cells. Many different species of sponges exist, and they can thrive in many different climates.<br><b>Movement</b><br>Sponges have no muscles and are largely sedentary, though a few species are able to move extremely slowly as a result of pinacocytes' amoeba-like movement. Movement inside the sponge is made possible by choanocytes, or sponges' “hearts.” In these specialized cells, whip-like tails power the pumping of molecules throughout the labyrinth of canals within the sponge.<br><b>Defense</b><br>Sponges do not have nerves or a nervous system for defense. Their survival, however, is aided by unique cell communication - even when separated, sponge cells can find their way back to each other and start growing new sponges. To support the body, sponges are held together by soft collagen. Additionally, structures known as spicules provide structural support, and when shedded, form a dense carpet around the sponge that deters predators. Finally, sponges do not have a developed immune system, but are able to reject foreign material and release toxins to remove it. Some sponges also release toxins to deter predators.</div></div>
